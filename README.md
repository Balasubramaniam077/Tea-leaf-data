In the serene tea fields of Kaithala, Tamil Nadu, India, a dedicated team embarked on a fascinating journey to delve into the intricacies of tea leaf diseases. Armed with nothing but a simple mobile camera, they skillfully captured images of the tea leaves under the guidance of local tea farmers. The objective was clear: to scrutinize the health status of these leaves and identify any signs of disease. The collaboration with native tea farmers was invaluable, as their deep knowledge of the tea plants guided the researchers in distinguishing healthy leaves from those affected by ailments. The real-time dataset collection unfolded amidst the lush greenery, reflecting the genuine connection between technology and tradition.

In the meticulous process of dataset preparation, the captured images transformed, resized to a standardized 224x224 pixel format. This step was crucial as it paved the way for the application of sophisticated transfer learning algorithms â€“ computer programs designed to learn and understand patterns from the images. The significance of this research extends beyond the pixels; it represents a harmonious blend of modern technology and the timeless wisdom of tea farming. From the initial click of the mobile camera to the detailed scrutiny of pixelated images, the narrative unfolds as a testament to the collaborative efforts aimed at preserving the health and vitality of tea leaves in Kaithala.

Raw Image to Pre-Processing Steps:

Image Resolution Changes to 224x224 Pixels for Image Classification:

Resizing images to a standardized resolution, such as 224x224 pixels, is a common practice for image classification tasks. This ensures consistency in input size for the neural network model.
Color Corrections to Improve Accuracy:

Color correction is a crucial step in image processing to enhance the quality and accuracy of the images. This can involve adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and other color attributes to ensure that the model receives consistent and meaningful information.
Splitting Disease Effect or Not Using Local Features:

Utilizing local features, such as key points or patterns, to distinguish between healthy and diseased tea leaves is a smart approach. This could involve employing techniques like local binary patterns (LBP), corner detection, or other feature extraction methods to capture distinctive characteristics.
Analyzing points from local features in the tea farm allows for a more detailed understanding of disease effects. This involves:
Identifying key points in the images that correspond to disease-affected areas.
Profiling these points with relevant information, such as disease severity, affected leaf regions, and any other pertinent details.
Providing a professional and comprehensive analysis of the disease impact based on the localized information.
